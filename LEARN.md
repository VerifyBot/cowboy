# Learning
This project helped me learn about networking, fullstack and deployment. I highly encourage you to go over the code and possible create a similar multiplayer game.

## Resources
List of resources that I used:

- What is a WebSocket & JS Websocket API - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API
- Python Websockets Library - https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
- Vue Docs - https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html
- Vuetify Docs - https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/#installation
- Nginx Docs - https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/load_balancing.html
- Free SSL - https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/
- Free Subdomain - https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting
- DigitalOcean Droplets - https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/


## Recommended way to learn
Start by creating a simple websockets client & server, then make it a game, set up private games with keys and reconnection. <br/>
Once you game works, start working on the UI, this will encourage you to add even more features. <br/>
When you feel comfortable with the game, deploy it! Get a free-trial on DigitalOcean and setup the server there. <br/>

> [!NOTE]
> You will likely have trouble in the way, that's good - it means that you are learning.
